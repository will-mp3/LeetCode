"""You are given an integer n which represents an array nums containing the numbers from 1 to n in order. 
Additionally, you are given a 2D array conflictingPairs, where conflictingPairs[i] = [a, b] indicates that a and b form a conflicting pair.

Remove exactly one element from conflictingPairs. 
Afterward, count the number of non-empty subarrays of nums which do not contain both a and b for any remaining conflicting pair [a, b].

Return the maximum number of subarrays possible after removing exactly one conflicting pair.
