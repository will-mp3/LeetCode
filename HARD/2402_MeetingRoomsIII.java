"""
You are given an integer n. There are n rooms numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are given a 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [starti, endi] means that a meeting will be held during the half-closed time interval [starti, endi). 
All the values of starti are unique.

Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:

Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the lowest number.
If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the same duration as the original meeting.
When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original start time should be given the room.
Return the number of the room that held the most meetings. If there are multiple rooms, return the room with the lowest number.

A half-closed interval [a, b) is the interval between a and b including a and not including b.

"""
this code defines a solution to the problem of scheduling meetings in rooms, ensuring that the room with the lowest number is used first, and handling delays when no rooms are available. 
The algorithm efficiently tracks room availability and counts the number of meetings held in each room, ultimately returning the room that hosted the most meetings.
The code uses a greedy approach to allocate rooms based on availability and meeting start times, ensuring that the room with the lowest number is prioritized. 
It maintains an array to track when each room will be available and counts the number of meetings held in each room. 
The final result is determined by finding the room with the highest meeting count, returning the room number with the lowest index in case of ties.
