"""
You are given an integer array nums.
A subsequence sub of nums with length x is called valid if it satisfies:

(sub[0] + sub[1]) % 2 == (sub[1] + sub[2]) % 2 == ... == (sub[x - 2] + sub[x - 1]) % 2.
Return the length of the longest valid subsequence of nums.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
