"""
this solution uses the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to group all synonyms into connected components. 
each word is assigned a representative root, and synonyms are merged under a common root using the union and find functions, 
with path compression for efficiency. 
after building the synonym groups, we map each group root to its full set of synonyms. 
the input sentence is then split into words, and for each word, we collect all possible replacements from its synonym group 
(or leave it unchanged if no synonyms exist). 
finally, we use itertools.product to compute the Cartesian product of these word choicesâ€”generating all valid synonym-substituted sentences. 
the output is sorted lexicographically for consistency. 
this approach efficiently generates all sentence variations that preserve the meaning while accounting for synonym relationships.
